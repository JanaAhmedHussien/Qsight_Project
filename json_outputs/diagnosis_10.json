  "llm_narrative_summary": "Imagine the back of your eye has a delicate network of tiny blood vessels, like very fine pipes.\n\n**Mild diabetic retinopathy** means that a *few* of these tiny blood vessels in your retina have started to show very early signs of damage because of high blood sugar from diabetes.\n\nHere's what that typically means:\n\n1.  **Tiny Leaks:** Some of the small blood vessels might become slightly weakened and develop tiny, pinprick-sized bulges (called microaneurysms) or even leak a tiny bit of fluid or blood.\n2.  **No Symptoms (Usually):** Crucially, because these changes are so small and few, people with mild diabetic retinopathy **usually don't notice any changes in their vision.** It doesn't typically blur your sight at this stage.\n3.  **Early Warning Sign:** It's an early warning sign that your diabetes is starting to affect your eyes. It means your eye doctor can see these changes during a comprehensive eye exam.\n\nThe main goal at this stage is to **manage your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol very well** to prevent the condition from getting worse and becoming more severe. Regular dilated eye exams are essential to monitor these changes."
