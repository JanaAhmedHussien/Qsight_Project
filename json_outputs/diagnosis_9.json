    "condition_overview": "Diabetic retinopathy, a microvascular complication of diabetes affecting the retina. Bilateral mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) confirmed. Confidence 85.5%.",
    "patient_assessment": "Patient 45M with established diabetes. BMI 24.49. Insulin dependent. Non-smoker. Low alcohol consumption. No history of vascular disease. Risk score 4.0 indicates ongoing risk of progression. Mild DR presence necessitates strict systemic control.",
    "implications": "Potential for progression to moderate/severe NPDR, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), or diabetic macular edema (DME). Visual impairment, vision loss, or blindness possible if untreated. Systemic microvascular complications (nephropathy, neuropathy) frequently co-occur.",

        "Dilated fundus examination every 6-12 months.",

    "financial_impact": "Ongoing costs include: regular ophthalmologic examinations, diagnostic imaging (OCT, FA). Potential future therapies: anti-VEGF injections, laser treatments, vitrectomy, systemic medication costs.",
    "recovery_projection": "Adherence to systemic and ophthalmic management can stabilize disease, slow progression, and preserve vision. Reversal of existing microvascular damage is limited; primary goal is preventing further deterioration and vision loss. Early intervention improves prognosis.",
    "additional_assessments": [
      "Referral to endocrinologist for comprehensive diabetes management review.",
      "Baseline HbA1c, lipid panel, and renal function tests.",

      "Neurology/Nephrology consultation if systemic neuropathy or nephropathy suspected."
    ],
    "compliance_notice": "Strict adherence to follow-up schedules is critical for early detection of disease progression. Consistent glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control significantly impacts retinopathy outcomes. Non-compliance increases risk of irreversible vision loss."
