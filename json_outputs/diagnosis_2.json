    "condition_overview": "The patient has been diagnosed with a mild condition affecting both the left and right eyes. The confidence level for this diagnosis is 85.5%. The associated risk score is 4.0, which typically indicates a low to moderate risk level.",
    "patient_assessment": "Mr. Test Patient is a 45-year-old male with a healthy BMI of 24.49. Key health factors include an insulin level of 12.0, which should be monitored, as elevated insulin can sometimes be linked to systemic conditions affecting ocular health. He is a non-smoker and reports low alcohol consumption, both positive factors for general and ocular health. There is no history of vascular disease, which is favorable given that many eye conditions can be exacerbated by vascular issues.",
    "implications": "A mild eye condition, while currently not severe, may lead to subtle visual disturbances, discomfort, or reduced clarity. Without proper management, there is a potential for progression, which could lead to more significant vision impairment over time. Early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent worsening of the condition and maintain visual function.",
    "treatment_plan": "The initial treatment plan for a mild eye condition often involves regular monitoring by an ophthalmologist to track any changes. Depending on the specific nature of the 'mild' condition, management may include lifestyle modifications, such as protective eyewear, hydration, dietary adjustments, and potentially prescription eye drops or over-the-counter remedies. If related to systemic issues like insulin resistance, managing the underlying condition is also paramount.",
    "life_impact": "Given the 'mild' nature of the condition, the current impact on daily life is expected to be minimal. The patient may experience occasional symptoms such as mild blurriness, dryness, or sensitivity, which are generally manageable. Regular activities, work, and hobbies should largely remain unaffected, though heightened awareness of eye health and compliance with any prescribed management will be important.",
    "financial_impact": "The financial impact for a mild eye condition primarily involves costs associated with regular eye examinations and specialist consultations. There may also be expenses for prescribed medications (e.g., eye drops), over-the-counter remedies, and potentially protective eyewear. Should the condition progress or require more specialized interventions in the future, costs could increase, but for a mild stage, they are expected to be manageable.",
    "recovery_projection": "With consistent monitoring and adherence to the recommended treatment plan, the goal is to stabilize the mild eye condition and prevent its progression. While 'recovery' in the sense of complete reversal may depend on the specific underlying cause, maintaining current vision and preventing deterioration is a realistic projection. Early and proactive management significantly improves the long-term outlook.",
    "additional_assessments": "Further assessments should include a comprehensive ophthalmological examination, possibly including dilated fundus examination, visual acuity tests, intraocular pressure measurement, and potentially specialized imaging (e.g., OCT, visual fields) to precisely identify the nature of the mild condition. Consultation with an endocrinologist may be warranted given the insulin level to assess for diabetes or insulin resistance.",
