    "condition_overview": "Bilateral mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Characterized by microaneurysms and dot-blot hemorrhages. Diagnosis confidence 85.5%.",
    "patient_assessment": "45-year-old male with mild bilateral diabetic retinopathy. BMI within normal limits (24.49). Non-smoker, low alcohol use. No history of vascular disease. Insulin level of 12.0 suggests uncontrolled or long-standing diabetes requiring ongoing management. Risk score 4.0 indicates moderate risk for progression without intervention.",
    "implications": "Potential for retinopathy progression to moderate/severe NPDR, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and diabetic macular edema (DME). Risk of vision loss or blindness if disease advances and remains untreated. Microvascular damage may indicate systemic microvascular disease.",
    "treatment_plan": {
      "clinical_interventions": [
        "Optimize glycemic control: Target HbA1c <7%.",
        "Optimize blood pressure control: Target <130/80 mmHg.",
        "Optimize lipid management: Achieve target lipid levels.",
        "Regular ophthalmic examinations: Dilated fundus exam every 6-12 months, or as clinically indicated."
      ],
      "monitoring": [
        "Serial fundus photography for documentation and comparison.",
        "Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) of macula to rule out diabetic macular edema.",
        "Visual acuity monitoring at each visit."
      ],
      "lifestyle_guidance": [
        "Diet: Focus on low glycemic index foods, reduced saturated fats, increased antioxidants.",
        "Eye protection: Consistent use of UV-protective eyewear (sunglasses).",
        "Physical activity: Engage in regular, moderate-intensity exercise.",
        "Smoking: Abstinence (patient is non-smoker).",
        "Alcohol: Continue low intake."
      ]
    },
    "life_impact": "Currently no significant impact on daily vision or activities at this mild stage. Requires ongoing adherence to medical appointments and lifestyle modifications. Potential for future visual impairment with disease progression.",
    "financial_impact": "Expected costs include regular ophthalmic examinations, diagnostic imaging (OCT, fundus photography), and systemic diabetes management medications. Potential future costs include laser therapy, anti-VEGF injections, or vitrectomy if retinopathy progresses.",
    "recovery_projection": "With stringent glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control, progression of retinopathy can be slowed or halted. Visual acuity is expected to remain stable at this stage with consistent adherence to treatment and monitoring.",
    "additional_assessments": [
      "Referral to primary care physician/endocrinologist for optimization of diabetes management.",
      "Annual comprehensive metabolic panel including HbA1c, fasting glucose, and lipid profile.",
      "Renal function assessment (microalbuminuria screening)."
    ],
    "compliance_notice": "Strict adherence to scheduled ophthalmic follow-up examinations, systemic medical management, and lifestyle modifications is crucial for preserving vision and preventing disease progression."
